    Healthy People 2030 is a national public health initiative in the United States that aims to improve the health and well-being of all Americans. The initiative was launched in 2010 as an update to Healthy People 2020, which had been in place since 2000.
    The main objectives of Healthy People 2030 are to:
        1. Increase the quality and years of healthy life for all Americans, including those with disabilities and special health care needs.
        2. Achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups.
        3. Create social and physical environments that promote good health for all.
        4. Promote quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages.
        5. Foster the development of research and data collection to improve the understanding of health and disease.
    Overall, the goal of Healthy People 2030 is to create a nation where all people can live long, healthy, and productive lives, free from preventable illness and disability.

    In this presentation, we will be focusing specifically on two of the SDOH: education and access. Education is an important determinant of health because it influences an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities to make healthy choices. 
    Access, on the other hand, refers to the availability and affordability of resources that support good health, such as health care services, healthy food, and safe housing.
    We will be discussing the ways in which these two SDOH intersect and how they can impact an individual's health and well-being.

    It has been well-established that education can have a significant impact on an individual's health behaviors and outcomes. One of the ways in which education can affect health is through diet. Groups with higher levels of education tend to have healthier diets, with higher rates of whole fruit consumption and lower rates of unhealthy choices like fast food and sugary drinks.
    In addition to healthier diet choices, higher levels of education have also been linked to lower rates of obesity among adults. This is likely due to the fact that individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to be aware of the health implications of their food choices and to have the knowledge and resources to make healthier choices.
    When it comes to which regions would be most positively impacted by educational initiatives, it is important to consider the specific health needs and challenges of each community. However, in general, regions with higher rates of poverty and lower levels of education may stand to benefit the most from educational interventions. By increasing access to education and improving the overall level of education in a community, it is possible to address some of the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to poor health outcomes.
    It's a well-known fact that people with low income and low accessibility to healthy food tend to consume less whole fruit. This lack of nutrients can lead to chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
    But there's a solution! Localizing and maximizing food growth in these areas can benefit the local economy, food supply, and even consumption behavior. By growing fruit locally, we can make it more accessible and affordable for those in need. Not only will this improve the health of individuals in the community, but it can also stimulate the local economy and create jobs.
    So, which regions would be most positively impacted by local fruit growth initiatives? It's important to consider factors such as climate, soil quality, and market demand. For example, regions with a long growing season and fertile soil may be well-suited for fruit production. Similarly, areas with a high demand for fresh fruit may also be good candidates for local fruit growth initiatives.
    Overall, local fruit growth initiatives have the potential to improve the health and well-being of communities, while also supporting the local economy and creating a more sustainable food system.

    The map shows the percentage of low access and low income populations in each state.
    As you can see, some states have a higher percentage of low access and low income populations than others. These regions may be good candidates for initiatives that aim to improve access to healthy food and stimulate the local economy.
    In states with a higher percentage, these initiatives can help to improve the health and well-being of the community, while also supporting the local economy and creating jobs.

    On this slide we are comparing obesity rates from 2011 with rates from 2022, and looking at how these rates vary by education level.
    As you can see from the chart, obesity rates have increased across all education levels from 2011 to 2022. However, there are some notable differences between the groups.
    For example, individuals with a high school education or less have consistently higher obesity rates compared to those with a college education or higher. In 2011, approximately 32% of individuals with a high school education or less were obese, compared to 21% of individuals with a college education or higher. By 2022, these rates had increased to 39% and 25%, respectively.
    This data highlights the importance of addressing obesity at all education levels, as it affects a significant portion of the population. It also suggests that individuals with lower levels of education may be disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, and may benefit from targeted interventions and support.

PAGE 7:
    On this slide we are looking at a bar chart showing the percentage of obese individuals in each of the 50 contiguous states.
    As you can see, the states with the highest percentage of obese individuals are on the right.
    The list shows the top ten with highest percentage. These states have obesity rates of over 35%, which is significantly higher than the national average.
PAGE 8:
    Upon closer examination, we will also see that these states have some of the lowest percentages of the population with a bachelor's degree. 
    In West Virginia, for example, approximately 25% or less of the population has a bachelor's degree, while in Kentucky and Oklahoma, this figure is around 30%.
    On the left is the list of 10 states with highest obesity. I wanted to show a side by side to see if there are is much overlap of the two. You can see many states with low education are on the list with high obesity rates.
PAGE 9:
    It's worth noting that West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are amongst the states with the lowest percentages of the population meeting the recommended fruit intake. These states also have high rates of obesity and low education levels, which may contribute to the low fruit intake.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends that adults consume at least two cups of fruit per day as part of a healthy and balanced diet.
This choropleth shows darker states as having a smaller percentage of the population meeting recommend amounts, and lighter colors displaying states with a higher percentage of individuals meeting the recommended intake.

Knowing which fruit trees are suitable for a particular hardiness zone can be helpful for improving food production and access to nutritious food in poorer regions. By planting fruit trees that are suited to the region's hardiness zone, farmers and gardeners can improve their chances of success and increase the likelihood of producing a crop.
In addition to increasing food production, planting fruit trees can also provide other benefits to Low Access Low Income regions. Fruit trees can provide a source of income for farmers and gardeners, as they can sell the fruit they produce. This can help to boost the local economy and improve the overall prosperity of the region.
Fruit trees can also provide a source of nutritious food for the local community. Fresh fruit is a healthy and tasty source of vitamins and minerals, and by planting fruit trees, the effected regions can increase their access to fresh produce and improve the overall health of the population.
Conclusion:


Overall, knowledge of hardiness zones and fruit trees can be a useful tool for improving food production and access to nutritious food in poorer regions. By planting fruit trees that are suited to the region's hardiness zone, farmers and gardeners can increase their chances of success, boost the local economy, and improve the overall health and well-being of the community.
