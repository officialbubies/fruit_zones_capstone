# fruit_zones_capstone

The goal of this project is to build an ongoing interactive visual aid in the form of a map. Its purpose is to display varying fruit tree varieties and in which hardiness zones each type grows. 

The map includes selectable layers to display multiple choropleths displaying Low Income, Low access populations by state and hardiness zones, so users can see which areas have high need, and which varieties can grow in those areas. 
 
I will bring in more data to analyze the health and consumption rates of different regions to aid in a better understanding of the real-world need for access to fresh whole fruit to reduce the risk of future chronic illness in the population.
